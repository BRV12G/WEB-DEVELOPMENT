# 📘 Web Development Concepts – Q&A Guide

A comprehensive list of essential web development questions with clear, beginner-to-advanced level answers.

---

## ❓ What is SSR + SSG?

### SSR (Server-Side Rendering)
- Renders HTML on **each request** at the server.
- Great for dynamic, personalized, or frequently changing pages.

✅ **Use Case**: Dashboards, User Profiles  
🛠️ Example: `getServerSideProps` in Next.js

---

### SSG (Static Site Generation)
- Renders HTML **at build time** and serves as static files.
- Super fast and good for SEO.

✅ **Use Case**: Blogs, Marketing Pages  
🛠️ Example: `getStaticProps` in Next.js

---

## ❓ What Are Build Tools and Why Are They Used?

Build tools automate:
- **Transpilation** (e.g., ES6 to ES5)
- **Bundling** of JS/CSS
- **Minification**
- **Asset Optimization**

### Popular Build Tools:
- **Vite** – Lightning fast dev server
- **Webpack** – Highly configurable bundler
- **Parcel** – Zero-config option

✅ **Use Case**: Prepping your code for production

---

## ❓ What Are Package Managers and Their Use?

Package managers handle:
- Installing dependencies (libraries/tools)
- Managing versions
- Resolving conflicts

### Examples:
- `npm` – Default for Node.js
- `yarn` – Faster alternative
- `pnpm` – Disk-efficient

```bash
npm install react
yarn add axios
pnpm install tailwindcss
```

---

## ❓ What Does the Backend Do?

The backend is responsible for:
- Business logic and rules
- Database operations (CRUD)
- API development
- Authentication & Authorization
- Background jobs, real-time handling
- Third-party integrations (Stripe, Mail, etc.)

✅ **Use Case**: Everything not visible to the user

---

## ❓ What Are APIs and Their Use?

### API = Application Programming Interface  
Enables communication between frontend and backend or services.

---

### 🔸 REST API
- HTTP-based (GET, POST, etc.)
- Stateless, resource-based

✅ Use for standard CRUD apps

---

### 🔸 GraphQL
- Query exactly the data you need
- Single endpoint

✅ Use for complex/nested data (e.g., dashboards)

---

### 🔸 gRPC
- Fast binary-based communication
- Uses `.proto` files

✅ Use in microservices, internal APIs

---

### 🔸 WebSockets
- Persistent two-way connection

✅ Use in real-time apps (chat, games, live updates)

---

## ❓ SQL vs NoSQL – When to Use?

### SQL (Relational)
- **Examples**: PostgreSQL, MySQL
- Structured schema, strong relations

✅ Use for: Ecommerce, banking, inventory

---

### NoSQL (Non-relational)
- **Examples**: MongoDB, Firebase, Redis
- Flexible schema, document or key-value based

✅ Use for: Real-time data, user activity, IoT, quick prototyping

---

## ❓ What is DevOps and Why Do We Need It?

### DevOps = Dev + IT Operations  
Helps deliver apps faster with:
- Automation (CI/CD)
- Consistency across environments
- Monitoring & scaling

---

### Tools & Use Cases

| Tool              | Use Case                                  |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| **Docker**         | Containerize your app, isolate environments |
| **Kubernetes**     | Orchestrate and scale Docker containers    |
| **GitHub Actions** | Automate builds/tests/deploys from Git     |
| **Vercel/Netlify** | Deploy frontend with CI/CD                 |
| **Jenkins**        | Self-hosted automation server              |
| **Heroku/Render**  | Simple full-stack app hosting              |

---

## ❓ Types of Testing – Unit vs E2E

### 🧪 Unit Testing
- Tests isolated functions or components
- Fast and localized

🛠️ Tools: Jest, Mocha, Vitest  
✅ Use for: Utility functions, logic, API endpoints

---

### 🧪 End-to-End (E2E) Testing
- Simulates user behavior across the app

🛠️ Tools: Cypress, Playwright  
✅ Use for: Testing flows like login, form submission, checkout

---

## ❓ What is Authentication and Security?

### 🔐 Auth Tools & Use Cases

| Tool                | Description                                  |
|---------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| **OAuth 2.0**        | Used for social login (Google, GitHub, etc.) |
| **JWT**              | Token-based authentication (stateless)       |
| **Auth0**            | Full-featured auth as a service              |
| **Firebase Auth**    | Quick setup for mobile/web apps              |
| **Passport.js**      | Middleware for custom auth in Node.js        |
| **Clerk / Supabase** | Drop-in auth with user management            |

## ❓ What is CMS? What is Headless CMS?

### 📚 Traditional CMS
- Includes both **content** and **frontend**
- Example: **WordPress**

✅ Use for: Blogs, content-driven sites with low development effort

---

### 🧠 Headless CMS
- Backend only (content is served via API)
- Frontend is built separately

| CMS         | Description                                   | Use Case                         |
